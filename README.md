<img src="images/hero-image-ms1.png">

  * The Hero Image has a static image that contains no animation, as it would be distracting and wouldn't fit with the main view of the page. 
  The hero image is trying to reach across the main message on this page, which is inclusiveness in LGBTQ+ community that is also connected throught the love of music. 

* Jumbotron

    The Jumbotron also contains one of the very few color item links on the page. 

* Footer
<img src="images/footer-ms1.png">

    * The Footer is consituted by three columns.
    The first column contains the contact info of the store and it's address, by adding the contacts to the footer which is one of the main elements that is consistent in all 3 pages, the user is able to see it at all times, therefore making it easier to find.

    The second column contains all the social links in which the Website is represented. 
    All the icons are grey apart from one as it provides a nice eye catching feature the bottom of the page.
    Besides the single colour icon, each of the social icons have their own colour when hovering over them as well.

    The Third Column is an informative text about Donations to the charity shop. 
    By adding this to the footer it gives it importance but it doesn't make it look like it's the main objective of this charity shop.

* Gallery
<img src="images/gallery-ms1.png">

   * The Gallery is the second page of _The Heart Of Vinyls_ website and it is constituted by the navbar, the footer and a selection of images forming a gallery display. 

   All the images are related to Vinyls themselves or music, and LGBTQ+ Community. 

   To Be able to make this images stand out from just becoming a static gallery, an image zoom animation was added for everytime it's hovered over.
