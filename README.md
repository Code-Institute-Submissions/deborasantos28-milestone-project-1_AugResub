   For this Navbar the design has been kept simple and tidy in it's appearence. 

* Hero Image
<img src="images/hero-image-ms1.png">

  * The Hero Image has a static image that contains no animation, as it would be distracting and wouldn't fit with the main view of the page. 
  The hero image is trying to reach across the main message on this page, which is inclusiveness in LGBTQ+ community that is also connected throught the love of music. 

* Jumbotron
<img src="images/jumbotron-ms1.png">

    * The Jumbotron layout is kept quite simple and neat. 
    The Jumbotron main function is to briefly explain the purpose of the Website and also extend an invitation for anyone that wishes to join the community, they can do so here through the **Join us** button.

* Footer
<img src="images/footer-ms1.png">

    * The Footer is consituted by three columns.
    The first column contains the contact info of the store and it's address, by adding the contacts to the footer which is one of the main elements that is consistent in all 3 pages, the user is able to see it at all times, therefore making it easier to find.

    The second column contains all the social links in which the Website is represented. 
    All the icons are grey apart from one as it provides a nice eye catching feature the bottom of the page.
    Besides the single colour icon, each of the social icons have their own colour when hovering over them as well.

    The Third Column is an informative text about Donations to the charity shop. 
    By adding this to the footer it gives it importance but it doesn't make it look like it's the main objective of this charity shop.

* Gallery
<img src="images/gallery-ms1.png">

   * The Gallery is the second page of _The Heart Of Vinyls_ website and it is constituted by the navbar, the footer and a selection of images forming a gallery display. 

   All the images are related to Vinyls themselves or music, and LGBTQ+ Community. 

   To Be able to make this images stand out from just becoming a static gallery, an image zoom animation was added for everytime it's hovered over.

Need to include user stories 

# User Stories
* As a member of the community I would like to be able to contribute more towards the LGBTQ+ community, as well as be more involved in activities and meet more individuals within the community. 
Also, I feel that by donating to this charity is an oportunity to give back to people that have given so much as well. 
With this in mind, the target for this platform is as follows:
  * Creating a safe space to be able to meet and share without prejudice
  * All the money is reverted back into the community by helping the victims of abuse, violence and homophobia
  * Share the love for music and the vintage with vinyl trading and selling.   

# Credits

* For the Media Queries I used the W3Schools example provided. 

* This project was made by using some of Bootstraps code.
