    * The Footer is consituted by three columns.
    The first column contains the contact info of the store and it's address, by adding the contacts to the footer which is one of the main elements that is consistent in all 3 pages, the user is able to see it at all times, therefore making it easier to find.

    The second column contains all the social links in which the Website is represented. 
    All the icons are grey apart from one as it provides a nice eye catching feature the bottom of the page.
    Besides the single color icon, each of the social icons have their own color when hovering over them as well.
